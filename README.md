# southern railway smartcard delay repay

## Why?
Because the Southern Railway Delay Repay form is awful if you hold a smartcard.
Just [look at it](https://www.southernrailway.com/your-journey/customer-services/delay-repay/delay-repay-form)!

* What's with all the red text everywhere?!
* Why isn't there a separate form for smartcard holders, rather than mashing the two forms together?!
 
Inspired by [@rem](https://twitter.com/rem/status/592333171578032128) this chrome extension will make this form simpler for smartcard holders.
